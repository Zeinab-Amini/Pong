# Pong
In this project, with the help of the libraries Turtle and time, a screen is created.
The elements in this project are the two sticks and the ball that they play with.
After these elemts are created, I made four functions that if you hit the up and down key, the first stick will move.
The same goes with the second stick but with the w key and the s key. 
The rest of the code is in a while loop to move the sticks and to make the ball bounce off of the sticks.
